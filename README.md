# README
## Reshade Motion Blur
1. Use an up to date version of [Reshade](https://reshade.me/)
2. Download this shader and Ehsan's [Motion Vectors](https://gist.github.com/mj-ehsan/4f60386e4eb7cb4cbb1f2087e4786f9a). Alternatively JakobPCoder's [Motion Estimation Shader](https://github.com/JakobPCoder/ReshadeMotionEstimation) or Marty McFly's [Motion Estimation](https://gist.github.com/martymcmodding/69c775f844124ec2c71c37541801c053) also works.
3. Put both shaders in your Shaders folder.
4. When you are ingame, activate both shaders and place the "Motion Vectors/Estimation" above "LinearMotionBlur".
5. Have Fun!
